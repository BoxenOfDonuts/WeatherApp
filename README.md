# WeatherApp
This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/weather-app).

# Thoughts... :thinking:
This project was getting me familiar with async / await as well as using fetch. What I really learned was working with asyncrounous code makes things complex fast! I added some barebones form validation of my own free will, but if I really want to complete it I'll need to come back and implement some custom error messages. For now it shouldn't break all over the place though.
